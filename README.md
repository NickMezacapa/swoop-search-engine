## Summary ðŸ“–
In today's digital landscape, privacy concerns have become increasingly important. Traditional search engines, despite their convenience, often leave traces of user metadata and create user profiles without explicit consent. This can lead to privacy invasions and curated search results that may not align with personal preferences.<br>

While privacy-focused alternatives like [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com/en/) and [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?va=b&t=hc) provide a level of data security, they may still fall short in offering a truly tailored and comprehensive solution. However, with *Swoop*, you have the unique opportunity to harness the power of a fully customized and meticulously designed search engine. By leveraging this platform, you can ensure unmatched data security and a personalized search experience that aligns perfectly with your individual preferences and privacy requirements. Experience the freedom and peace of mind that comes from using *Swoop* for your private browsing needs.<br>

Swoop combines [Searx](https://searx.github.io/searx/), [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/), Next.js, and TypeScript to safeguard user privacy and deliver efficient search functionality. Swoop aggregates results from multiple sources without tracking or profiling users, while offering [IP anonymization](https://complianz.io/are-your-ip-addresses-anonymized/), [SSL/TLS termination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy), and zero advertisements.<br>

Swoop demonstrates the successful integration of open-source tools, efficient server-side rendering, and optimized proxy server configuration to deliver a seamless and secure search experience.
